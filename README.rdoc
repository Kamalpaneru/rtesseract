Ruby library for working with the Tesseract OCR.

== REQUIREMENTS:

To work properly rtesseract are needed:
* Tesseract - Program
* ImageMagick - Program
* RMagick or mini_magick or quick_magick - Gem

Atention: Version 1.0.0 works fine with Ruby 2.0 and tesseract 3.0 and lower versions of rtesseract works fine with Ruby 1.8 and tesseract 2.0.4.

== EXAMPLE USAGE

It's very simple to use rtesseract:

=== CONVERT IMAGE TO STRING

  image = RTesseract.new("my_image.jpg")
  image.to_s #Getting the value

=== CHANGE THE IMAGE

  image = RTesseract.new("my_image.jpg")
  image.source = "new_image.png"
  image.to_s

=== TRANSFORM THE IMAGE

  image = RTesseract.read("my_image.jpg") do |img|
    img = img.white_threshold(245)
    img = img.quantize(256,Magick::GRAYColorspace)
  end
  image.to_s

=== CONVERT PARTS OF IMAGE TO STRING

  mix_block = RTesseract::Mixed.new("test.jpg") do |image|
    image.area(28,  19, 25, 25)
    image.area(180, 22, 20, 28)
    image.area(218, 22, 24, 28)
    image.area(248, 24, 22, 22)
  end
  mix_block.to_s

  OR

  mix_block = RTesseract::Mixed.new("test.jpg",{:areas => [
    {:x => 28,  :y=>19, :width=>25, :height=>25 },
    {:x => 180,  :y=>22, :width=>20, :height=>28},
    {:x => 218,  :y=>22, :width=>24, :height=>28},
    {:x => 248,  :y=>24, :width=>22, :height=>22}
  ]})
  mix_block.to_s

== Contributing to rtesseract
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
